<h3>Intro Post</h3>
  <p>Over Thanksgiving Break, I have been practicing the three ball cascade and started thinking about my project more. Before this, I wasn't able to juggle three balls, but now I am able to keep the balls up for at least three catches. This marks the start of my progress on this project and I am excited to keep adding on to this. In class, I have been working on setting up the design of this website and now that I am done with that, I can finally work on keeping up with my blog. Since I can't practice juggling in class, I've decided to take 30 minutes out of each of my weekends to practice juggling and the time in class to update my blog. Next weekend, I am going to master the three ball cascade enough that I can keep juggling for however long I want. I'll talk to you guys soon!</p>

<h3>12/18/18</h3>
  <p>Over the past couple weekends I've been working pretty hard on perfecting three balls, but it has been pretty difficult. Now I can juggle for about ten seconds until I drop the balls. I can't keep control of the balls for too long. Even though my plan was to perfect three balls by December 1st, I can't skip over the basics because it will affect how I perform with more balls. I have inserted a clip of about how long I can juggle three balls without dropping them. Even though it is difficult, my plan is to master the three ball juggling technique enough so I can keep the balls up for about thirty seconds until I drop them. Over Winter Break I can practice everyday with four balls and I'll be back on track.That's all for now, I'll talk to you guys soon.</p>

  <p>1/22- Hello everybody. Over the past couple of weekends, I've been trying pretty hard to learn four ball juggling, but I keep getting discouraged. It's pretty difficult to keep juggling and keep four balls up at the same time. Just a quick sneak peek at the tips and tricks section of the website that I created, you have to juggle two balls in each hand when juggling four balls. It's hard because there are two things that you have to concentrate on at the same time which are the two hands. Plus, both hands are at different points at different times which means that one hand is throwing while one hand is catching. This makes it difficult on me. I'm thinking about going back to practicing two balls with one hand and slowly integrating another hand until I can successfully juggle four balls. I'll practice this and I'll show you guys my progress next time. Bye!</p>
